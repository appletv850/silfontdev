This is a general overview of the day-to-day steps:

- making sure the basic foundation software is available and up-to-date (Docker, anvil, git)
- checking out or updating the desired git repository containing the font project sources
- spinning up a new container with the necessary software tools inside (or launching the existing container if it was created earlier)
- logging into the container and checking that the font sources in a shared folder on the host computer are visible from inside the container 
- cleaning the font project of any previous build results and temporary files
- configuring the project and checking if all the needed components are available
- running the build
- running the tests
- going through the files generated by the last build (in the __results/__ folder) 
- generating a development zip and tarball
- installing the freshly built fonts to allow for local testing
- examining the test results to examine any significant changes and possible regressions
- examining any relevant log files for warnings and errors
- making a new change to the font sources (using tools like preglyphs to prepare a temporary file to load into the font editor)
- running preflight or preflightg (which includes various checks, needed fixes and normalization) to generate canonical sources in UFO format
- launching another build with newly introduced changes
- examining the results of that new build (in the __results/__ folder) 
- if the project is set up on a Continuous Integration (CI) service, comparing the artefacts there as well
- committing the change to the git repository when satisfied 
- generating a release zip and tarball 
- adjusting the revelant documentation 
- tagging the desired version number in the repository 
- publishing the released artifact
