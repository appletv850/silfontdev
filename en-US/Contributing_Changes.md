Making changes is one thing, contributing changes so that they can become part of the original project and not just another fork is another. We want to keep the process of accepting changes low friction but we will probably be reviewing the changes thoroughly.

To maximize the chances of changes making it into an original version we need to consider the following: 

- making sure changes are expressed in open formats for interoperability: like UFOs and other non-opaque open standards. 
- preparing changes so they are correctly isolated from other changes (a minimal working example) and can easily be tested
- opening a Github issue to describe the proposed change 
- making a diff or a branch available publicly containing the changes, then submitting a PR (Pull Request) or MR (Merge Request)
- understanding the way copyright and the OFL (Open Font License) work and how to fill in an copyright statement and font metadata appropriately:
this means updating the copyright statement to add an extra entry but without removing any existing ones. 
- optionally providing the FONTLOG entry corresponding to the proposed change.

(more details on this later). 


We hope you will enjoy building and contributing to our open fonts and that they will fill a need. 

Let us know if you have any comments or suggestions to add to this guide. 

Thanks!
